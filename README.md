Based on the popular word game, the user will be prompted to select the length of the word they want to guess. The computer will randomly select a word of that length and prompt the user to begin guessing. After each guess, the computer will update the provided solution with either the letter in the correct spot or '\_', along with the available letters that may not have been in the correct spots and previous guesses. All words will be validated against word length.
